## Finite State Machine

Do NOT use in production. Package is NOT production ready.

Made just for fun.

#### Assumptions 
- A Finite State Machine is a model of computation based on a hypothetical machine made of one or more states 
- Only one single state of this machine can be active at the same time 
- Machine has to transition from one state to another in to perform different actions


Machine can apply transition to state. In result of transition Machine changes it's state.
